# Introduction
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) are known to spread through the lymphatic system and form metastases in lymph nodes [@mukherji_cervical_2001, @shah_patterns_1990]. To avoid nodal recurrences, lymph node levels (LNL) at risk of harbouring occult metastases are electively irradiated. Guidelines for different tumor locations [@biau_selection_2019] are based on the overall prevalence of nodal disease as reported in the literature [@mukherji_cervical_2001, @shah_patterns_1990].
To personalize the prediction of the risk of occult metastases, given a patient's individual diagnosis, we first published a large, multi-centric dataset where the lymphatic involvement per LNL is available for each patient[@ludwig_dataset_2022, @ludwig_multi-centric_2023].
Subsequently we published an interpretable hidden Markov model (HMM), trained with the data to predict the risk for occult nodal disease, given an individual patient's diagnosis [@ludwig_hidden_2021].
A personalized risk prediction may allow clinicians to safely reduce the elective clinical target volume (CTV-N) and reduce side-effects that degrade the patient's quality of life without compromising treatment efficacy [@batth_practical_2014].

So far we trained different models for different tumor locations such as oropharynx and oral cavity tumors. However, this approach does not describe differences in lymphatic spread between different subsites within the oropharynx and oral cavity. This resulted in distorted predictions for each subsite, as the spread patterns were pooled into one single model .To address this issue, we present an approach using mixtures of HMMs. The intuition is that the lymphatic spread of a tumor that lies anatomically at the border of oropharynx and oral cavity (e.g. tumors in the palate) may be described by a mixture of different models.

Since primary tumors at different subsites have different patterns of lymphatic spread patterns one would need to either generalize over several subsites as introduced in [@ludwig_dynamic_2021], where the HMM has been introduced for oropharyngeal cancer, or train a distinct model for each subsite. The former approach would lead to less precise predictions for each subsite, especially those subsites with few patients. Training one HMM per subsite would be rather time intensive and lead to large uncertainties for subsites with only few patients. Further we would not exploit the anatomical similarities which are expected for anatomically nearby locations. 

Therefore we introduce a mixture model which combines all subsites in a singular model exploiting anatomical proximities.
